# SteamRescue
Fixes any UI bug with Steam by restarting, refreshing and reloading all Steam cache.

IF IT DOESN'T WORK, TRY RUNNING AS ADMIN.

# 1st Method
Run the downloaded file (as admin) while Steam is running and having any issues.

# 2nd Method
When Steam is running and having any issues, hit Windows key + R at the same time and in the box that appears, paste this: "cmd.exe /c taskkill /f /im steam.exe & cd C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam & start steam.exe"
